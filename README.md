# Databricks-FMG Guide 
This guide draws from the experience coaching and various projects as well as the open source community.

On Databricks, specifically speaking, the source code of Spark is **written once**  by its author, but **read and modified multiple times** by lots of engineers which the future modification of the code may subsequently come with bugs.

As of the nature of Spark's codebase development, we need to optimize our codebase to be consistent with Spark to obtain a long-term, global readibility and maintainability. 

**A simple code is the most effective solution.**

## <a name='practice'>Development Guidance on Databricks/GitHub</a>
Gitbub practice that FMG follows:
- [The FMG Github flow process](https://farmersmutualgroup.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BIS/pages/1534328833/The+FMG+Github+flow+process+a+presentation+for+the+uninitiated)
- [Git& GitHub Best Practice](https://farmersmutualgroup.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BIS/pages/6750294/Git+GitHub+Best+Practice)
- [Current methodology: GitHub flow](https://farmersmutualgroup.atlassian.net/wiki/x/VYAKVg)

The Databricks flow we adopted for delivering solution differs a little bit from FMGâ€™s internal guidelines.

The key difference inhabits in the use of **dev-release** branch for delivering solution in which all intended changes should be merged before **master**.

Due to the interaction with repositories between Synapse and Databricks, an additional barrier (**dev-release**) is made made to protect **master** and allow the development to interate quickly as well as the testing so changes can be shared within the development environment.  

Key points to be followed on Databricks:
1. Always creating branch on the basis of dev-release branch where all intended changes should be merged into before master.
2. 
3.
